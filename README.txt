This repository contains data and code used in the following publication:

Starko et al. 2022. Ecological Applications. 
Microclimate predicts kelp forest extinction in the face of direct and indirect marine heatwave effects.

The repository is best accessed as an R project and contains two subdirectories, one containing data and the other containing code for analyses
In the "data" folder, there are the following subdirecties which include the raw data for each type of analysis:



health_growth - Data collected on growth rates and health metrics in the summer of 2020.

kelp_comparisons - Data used for all temporal and spatial comparisons of kelp distribution

Parks_Canada_sites - Data on the abundance of urchins, Pycnopodia and Macrocystis at six sites that were surveyed via SCUBA between 2013 and 2016. These data were collected by the Pacific Rim National Park team (led by Jennifer Yakimishyn).

photo_quad - Data collected using the subtidal "dropquadrat" - see paper for more details.

ROV - Data collected with the Trident ROV.

spatial_env_data - Spatially explicit data on temperature and nitrate+nitrite. This includes unpublished data collected by L.Druehl.

temporal_env_data - Time series temperature data.

tides_2015_2016 - Tide observations used to separate submerged from emergent rock temperatures


Note that not all datasheets in these folders were directly used alongside the R scripts. Some files were only used for ArcGIS mapping.
